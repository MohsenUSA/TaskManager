## 🗂️ Project Structure

### 1. **TaskManager.html**
The main application file containing:
- Complete UI/UX implementation
- Task rendering and management logic
- Excel file reading/writing functionality
- Real-time clock and time indicator system
- Search and filter engine
- Analytics and metrics dashboard

### 2. **Database.xlsx**
The Excel template/database file with three sheets:

> **Note:** The first 3 rows are reserved for instructions/headers and are automatically skipped during import. Tasks should be entered starting from Row 4.

#### ⚠️ Important: Date & Time Behavior

Understanding how Date and Time combinations work:

| Date | Time | Result |
|------|------|--------|
| ✅ Has date | ✅ Has time | Timed task for that specific date |
| ❌ No date | ✅ Has time | **Everyday** timed task (appears on ALL dates) |
| ✅ Has date | ❌ No time | **All-day** task for that specific date |
| ❌ No date | ❌ No time | **All-day** task for **every** date (always visible) |

#### 📥 Default Values on Import

When importing from Excel, missing fields are automatically filled with sensible defaults:

| Field | Default Value | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| **Date** | Everyday | Task appears on all dates (🔄 icon shown) |
| **Time** | All Day | Task appears in sticky blue section at top |
| **Priority** | Low | Green priority badge |
| **Assigned** | Everyone | Can be reassigned by clicking the badge |
| **Status** | Pending | Yellow status badge |

#### **Employees Sheet**
Lists all team members:
- **Name** (Column A) - Employee full name
- **Role** (Column B) - Optional role/title

> **Important:** "Everyone" must remain in Row 2 (mandatory). Add employee names starting from Row 3.
